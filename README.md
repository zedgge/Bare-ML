This is a tiny small NN built from scratch utalizing only raw python(no imports what so ever) it loads MNIST data from .csv files and trains the NN using backpropagtion and gradient decent to make predictions on handwritten digit images.

to get the .csv files for said program please to go https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv and download them there DISCLAMER: I am not associated with them I just like there stuff (github wont let me upload the files).

this program wasnt realy built for a real reason besides i wanted to play with some ML from scratch because it sounded fun .
